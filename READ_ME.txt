The main code is in the file "wire3.f90" which is a fortran code trying to solve the RG equations for local Sine-Gordon model.
You can input an arbitrary spectral function, the program finds the Matsubara Green's function (via Kramersâ€“Kronig relations).
The RG equations are then solved numerically using the following fortran libraries:"opkda1.f", "opkda2.f "opkdmain.f", and "quadpack.f90".

To run the code:

1. Open terminal and type what follows
2. gfortran -c wire3.f90
3. gfortran wire3.f90 opkda1.f opkda2.f opkdmain.f quapack.f -o a
4. ./a
5. you will get a txt-file including the UV cuoff and renormalized scattering potential
